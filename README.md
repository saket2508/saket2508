## 🚀 About Me

- 💻 Software Engineer at OpsLyft
- 🛠️ I enjoy building with full-stack TypeScript (React, Next.js, Zustand, Jotai), MERN, GraphQL, REST, Postgres, and WebRTC.
- ☁️ Comfortable crafting cloud-native workflows using AWS and integrating all kinds of services and APIs.
- 🤖 Always tinkering with new product ideas—especially if there’s a chance to mix in some AI and make things a little more delightful.

## 🧠 What Drives Me

I genuinely enjoy the creative process of building apps and tools that make life easier or just more interesting. But there’s more to life than coding—I’m always up for a good conversation, new ideas, or geeking out over something unexpected.
